    "\n",
    "Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable. The C compiler follows top-to-down execution, so the control flow can be easily managed in case of functions.\n",

The “def” call creates the function object and assigns it to the name given. You can further re-assign the same function object to other names.\n",
